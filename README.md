Blender Infrared and Radar Simulator (BLIRS)
============================================

This is cloned from https://www.iss.uni-stuttgart.de/download/blender-radar/Simulation.zip and is based on the published work for this article:

Monika Ouza, Michael Ulrich and Bin Yang  
A Simple Radar Simulation Tool for 3D Objects based on Blender  
Proc. Intern. Radar Symposium (IRS), June 2017  
https://doi.org/10.23919/IRS.2017.8008254

Currently this works only with the outdated Blender version 2.77.

The aim of this repository is to port the code to current Blender versions.
